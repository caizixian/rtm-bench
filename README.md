### Micro-benchmark for Restricted Transactional Memory

This is code is a small set of micro-benchmarks for testing the performance of Intel's Restricted Transactional Memory features added with Transactional Synchronization Extensions in Haswell micro-architecture processors.

Test code is not finished to a high standard, but hopefully might be of use, in education or the development of more complete benchmarks.
